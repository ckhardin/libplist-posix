This project implements a primitive library for handling property lists that can be integrated with a POSIX application. The intent is to make the concepts and notions of property lists available across Unix platforms.

At the start of this project, plists were developed as part of the NeXTSTEP, GNUstep, and Mac OS X development frameworks. Please refer to these systems for complete frameworks.
